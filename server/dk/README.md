Notes on form configuration:

- Check box / Other form data is not included in export files. To work around
  this, the marketing other option is a separate single line text item.
- The nickname registrant attribute is not included in export files. Many
  people set the registrant nickname to something other than their nickname
  (First Last for example). To work around these issues, we get the nickname
  from the form where we can explain the purpose of the field.
